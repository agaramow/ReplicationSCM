In this notebook, we present a relatively new tool of causal inference: The Synthetic Control Method (SCM), introduced by Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003). We demonstrate how the SCM it can be employed in practice and flesh out its advantages and disadvantages. For this purpose, we present and discuss selected results of the paper "Does Financial Deregulation Boost Top Incomes? Evidence from the Big Bang" by Tanndal and Waldenström, published in Economica in 2017. The authors exploit the sudden, large-scale financial deregulations episode, the "Big Bang" in the UK (1986) and Japan (1997 - 1999) to estimate the impact of government policies related to the financial market on the income distribution. Using the SCM, the analysis shows that top one per cent income shares and the Gini coefficient increased, while GDP per capita remained constant. On the background of a growing body of literature that employs the SCM, it is important to understand the underlying assumptions of the method and its benefits and drawbacks in practice. In the light of the potential outcome framework, we introduce the two fundamental problems of causal inference, discussing the plausability of the identification strategy. After presenting the underlying mechanism, we validate the main results and findings of the robustness checks, using the "synth" package by Abadie and Hainmueller. Finally, we extend the presented paper by two ideas. First, we analyse the effect of the Big Bang on the middle 40 and lower 50 percentile of the income distribution. Second, we examine the existence of an anticipation effect in the period 1984 until the implementation in 1986. While we find no significant effects on the lower income shares, we find evidence for an anticipation effect. Since this exercise could be easily done for UK and Japan and any top income shares equivalently, we will focus on replicating selected outcomes for the top one percentile in the UK throughout the project.
